A couple of laboratory (neural networks on matlab) projects i worked on.
List:
1. lb1 - simple non neural network image classifier.
2. lb2 - simple image classifier with linear regression.
3. lb3 - image classififer and funtion approximator (function activation - logsig).
4. lb45 - image dimension reduction.
5. lb678 - text predictor.
There is more information about each project in its files in comment lines.
I have a bit more material and projects im working on, and im going to upload them after i finish them.
